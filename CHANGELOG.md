# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0
Basic format to support various rolls (skill checks, clashes, damage)

## 0.2.0
- Statues exist in the backend
  - Need smarter ways to actually change their values

## 0.1.1
- Figured out a stupid naming error that made users unable to edit skills.

## 0.1.0
- The more barebones possible functionality for this to theoretically work as intended.
- Character hp, combat initiative, skills, all roll as intended.

## 0.0.1

- Mainly me just fumbling around learning to make this thing work
